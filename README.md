## Purpose

This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook written with Python that analyses and derives insights from the comparison of Seattle and Boston AirBnB data. The orignal data sets are saved from Kaggle in the inputs folder. Insights are derived from descriptive statistics and plotting visualizations. I take a look at
availability, pricing and amenities for listings between the two cities.

* ./input/sea_calendar.csv - Contains what appears to be availailites for listings in Seattle. Each listing is identified with an unique listing_id.
* ./input/sea_listings.csv - Specific information for individual listings, including amenities, owner, review scores and a large amount of other housing information for listings in Seattle. Each listing is identified with an unique listing_id.
* ./input/sea_reviews.csv - contains user reviews for AirBnB listings in Seattle. Each listing is identified with an unique listing_id.
